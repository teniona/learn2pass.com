      Let's Talk Driving Anxiety. 
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5vw; text-align: center;">Driving tests are an undeniable rite of passage - and just the idea of them can bring most of us out in a cold sweat. If you've got a serious case of pre-driving test nerves, here are the best ways to banish your driving anxiety.</p><br>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h6 style="color:red;font-size: 1.5vw;">Before you take your driving test:</h6>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
      Chat to your instructor about how you feel if you need reassurance.
      
      Ask your instructor if you should take any extra lessons to focus on things you find tricky.
      
      Accept that nerves are normal - you're bound to feel a bit anxious before you take your driving test. After all, you've worked really hard to get to this point. 
      
      You could keep the date and time of your test private to minimise stress. That way, if you pass it's a great surprise - and if you fail, you don't have to worry about telling people. 
      </p>

    <h6 style="color:red;font-size: 1.5vw;">The day before your test:</h6>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5vw;">Get some exercise. It'll help you relax that evening, and give you an endorphin boost - great for keeping a positive attitude. 

      Don't hit the town the night before - even if you're feeling anxious, you'll feel twice as bad the following day - and you might not legally be able to drive.
      
      Get plenty of sleep and book your test for the morning if you'd rather not worry about it all day. 
      </p>

    <h6 style="color:red;font-size: 1.5vw;">On the day of your test</h6>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5vw;">The trick is to treat it like it's just another normal day - try and stick to your routine as much as possible, whether that's going for a job, walking the dog, or just relaxing and watching some TV. 

      Lots of people book an extra lesson with their instructor to get used to the feeling of driving a car before their test, and so it's fresh in their memory. 
      
      Drink plenty of water but steer clear of too much caffeine - you want to feel alert, not totally wired.
      Switch your phone off or turn it to 'Airplane Mode' an hour before the test to help clear your mind.
      Eat a decent breakfast and dress comfortably - you want to be able to move freely and focus on your driving.
      Check the time of your test, the test centre address, and that you can get there in plenty of time to sit down and relax beforehand.
      If you need the moral support, take a friend or a family member with you.
      </p>
