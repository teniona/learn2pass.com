      Top 10 Reasons for Failing the Driving Test in the UK
    </h1><br>
    <h3 style="font-size: 3vw; text-align: center;"> 
      Perfect these skills before your test! 
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5vw;">This page explains the top 10 reasons people fail the car driving test in Great Britain.
      You need to be a good driver to pass the driving test. This guide gives examples of the types of mistakes people make during their test.

      <br>
      <span style="color:red; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">How to use this guide: </span><br>

You can use this guide with your driving instructor and supervising driver to practise these skills. 
If you regularly make any of the mistakes explained in this guide during your driving lessons, you’re not ready to take and pass your driving test.<br>
<br>



<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">1. Not making effective observations at junctions</span><br>
<br>


<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Failing to judge the speed of an approaching vehicle</span><br>
When you turn either left or right from a minor road, you make observations but fail to judge the speed of the approaching vehicle. You move off, forcing the vehicle to slow significantly.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Entering a roundabout with a vehicle approaching from the right</span><br>
When you approach a roundabout, there’s a vehicle approaching from the right. You still enter the roundabout, causing the vehicle approaching to slow down.<br>


<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Going straight ahead at a crossroads</span><br>
When you approach a crossroads, you do not recognise that it’s a junction. You emerge and cross the crossroads without making any observations to the right or left.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Looking too late</span><br>
When you emerge from a junction, you look too late (either left or right) for the observations to be effective, as you’re already partly into the next road.<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">2. Not using mirrors correctly when changing direction</span><br>
<br>


<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Causing a vehicle to slow when changing lanes on a dual carriageway</span><br>
When you’re on a dual carriageway, you check your mirrors when changing lanes, but there’s a vehicle approaching in the lane you want to move into. You start to change lanes anyway, causing the approaching vehicle to slow down.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Trying to change lane on a roundabout when a vehicle is directly alongside</span><br>
When you’re driving on a roundabout, you try to change lanes when there’s a vehicle directly alongside you. The driving examiner has to take control of the steering wheel to stop a collision.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Exiting a roundabout</span><br>
When you exit a roundabout, you do not check your mirrors and cut across the path of a closely following vehicle to the left-hand side of the car.<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">3. Not having proper control of the steering</span><br>
<br>


<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Repeatedly not steering enough or steering late on the approach to junctions when turning left</span><br>
Throughout the test, when you turn left, you repeatedly understeer, not following the shape of the kerb. This means there’s not enough space for vehicles turning right to fit alongside your car.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Not steering enough when going around a bend</span><br>
When you drive around a bend at an appropriate speed, you do not apply enough steering. This causes both passenger-side wheels to mount the pavement.<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">4. Incorrect positioning when turning right at junctions</span><br>
<br>


<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Obstructing traffic when you wait to turn right</span><br>
When you want to turn right into a minor road, you position your car too far to the left while you wait for oncoming traffic to clear. This causes severe delays to the following traffic on a road where it was wide enough for the traffic to pass you on the left.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">When you want to turn right at the end of the road, you incorrectly position to the left</span><br>
When you reach the end of a wide road with no road markings, you position in the left of your lane when you’re actually turning right.<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">5. Not moving off safely</span><br>
<br>


<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Moving off from behind a parked vehicle into the path of an approaching vehicle</span><br>
When you move off from behind a parked vehicle, you check your mirrors and blind spot, but still move off into the path of an approaching vehicle. This causes the vehicle to significantly slow down.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Pulling off from the right-hand side of the road, causing an oncoming vehicle to slow or stop</span><br>
After the ‘pull up on the right’ exercise, you move off with either an oncoming vehicle or a closely approaching vehicle from behind. This causes the vehicle to severely slow down or stop.<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">6. Not responding appropriately to traffic lights</span><br>
<br>


<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Failing to react to red traffic light</span><br>
When a red light is clearly showing, you attempt to proceed through the junction.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Stopping after the first white line when there are advanced stop lines for cyclists</span><br>
At a signal-controlled junction with an advanced stop line to allow cyclists to be positioned ahead of other traffic, you stop beyond the first white line in the area for cyclists.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">7. Poor positioning on the road during normal driving</span><br>
<br>

<span style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">You must be able to:</span><br>

Position the car correctly for your intended route<br>
Position the car in the middle of marked lanes<br>
Only change lanes when necessary<br>


<br>
<br>

<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">8. Not responding correctly to traffic signs</span><br>
<br>


<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Going to the wrong side of a ‘keep left’ sign</span><br>
You go to the wrong side of a ‘keep left’ sign in the road.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Driving in a bus lane</span><br>
You drive in a bus lane when a sign shows that you cannot use it at that time.<br>

<br>
<br>

<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">9. Not having control of the vehicle when moving off</span><br>
<br>


<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Stalling and rolling back when trying to move off</span><br>
When you move off at a green traffic light or during a hill start, you stall the car and roll back a considerable distance.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Repeatedly stalling when moving off</span><br>
Throughout your test, you repeatedly stall the car when you try to move off.<br>

<br>
<br>

<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">10. Not keeping control of the vehicle during reverse parking</span><br>
<br>


<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Wheels ending up on the pavement at the end of a parallel park</span><br>
When you complete a parallel park, either the front or back wheels (or both) on the passenger side end up on the pavement.<br>

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">Ending up parking outside of the bay</span><br>
When you park in a bay, your final parking position is outside of the lines of the bay.<br>
